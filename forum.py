I've been struggling with my mental health for over a year now, just shortly after my diagnosis of breast cancer. I'm fortunate enough to have a very loving family, but even still I feel alone because they don't know what it's like to go through this. I also feel guilty for not being able to be as strong of a mom as I used to be. Does it ever get better?");
